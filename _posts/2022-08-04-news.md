### Farewell Chris, June 2022
Farewell to Chris Johnson who has wrapped up his work on the TrEnCh project and moved on to work with [Sabine Rumpft](https://duw.unibas.ch/en/eco/) at the University of Basel. Stay tuned for a great paper exploring how well directly applying thermal performance curves predicts fitness responses to climate change relative to a population dynamic model that considers the thermal sensitivity of fitness components. Best wishes to Chris and family!

### Off the the CO Mountain Research Station, May 2022

### Farewell Abby, February 2022
The pandemic delay to Abby starting a [fellowship](https://www.avmey.com/#wallenberg) in Greenland is finally over. We're grateful that the delay allowed Abby to make amazing contributions to our TrEnCh project and are excited to follow Abby's Greenland adventure.
