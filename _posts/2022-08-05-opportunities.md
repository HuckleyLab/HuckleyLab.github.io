### Postdocs
Potential postdocs interested in pursuing funding together are encouraged to contact Lauren.  One excellent opportunity is the [Washington Research Foundation postdoc program](https://www.wrfseattle.org/grants/wrf-postdoctoral-fellowships/).

### Graduate Students
- WE ARE NOT PLANNING TO RECRUIT ADDITIONAL GRADUATE STUDENTS to start in Fall 2022. 
- The group is especially interested in recruiting students with quantitative skills (e.g., mathematics or computer science training, experience with a computing language such as R).  We also prioritize students interested in examining montane grasshopper or butterfly development and demography in the context of a resurvey project aimed at understanding responses to recent climate change.
- Please include “POTENTIAL GRAD” in the subject line of any email to Lauren, so that she can better keep track of inquiries.

Most research in the group concerns functional ecology, evolution, and biogeography in changing environments, a broad and complex topic leaving lots of room for creative and interdisciplinary approaches and independent projects. Students are encouraged to develop their own projects in collaboration with me. One focus of the lab is coupling theoretical and quantitative tools with data collection. I feel that combining multiple approaches is central to tackling questions of environmental change and a primary benefit of choosing to conduct graduate research in the Buckley lab. I anticipate that student projects will generally span two of the following three approaches: theory, ecoinformatic analysis, and field or lab work. My goal as a mentor is to ensure students learn how to identify interesting questions, develop feasible approaches, and process and synthesize information to address the question. While most of my current research is focused on small ectotherms (particularly insects), students seeking to ask similar questions in other systems will be encouraged to do so, particularly in collaboration with other research labs. See the (how_we_work repository)[https://github.com/HuckleyLab/how_we_work] on our lab GitHub account to learn more about our lab workflow and policies.

I accept students through the [UW Department of Biology](https://www.biology.washington.edu/programs/graduate), a fabulous place to be a graduate student.  Other relevant programs at UW include the [Program on Climate Change (PCC)](https://pcc.uw.edu/) and the [Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM)](https://quantitative.uw.edu/) interdisciplinary graduate program.

Students interested in joining the lab are encouraged to apply for external fellowships (e.g., National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, Environmental Protection Agency STAR Fellowship, Ford Foundation Predoctoral Diversity Fellowship). All prospective students should contact me by email. If it seems that you may be a good fit for my group, I will request the following materials:

- a curriculum vitae
- a description of research experience
- a description of possible graduate research topics and approaches highlighting why the Buckley group would be a good fit for this research
- a description of career goals

### Undergraduates and research scientists
There are numerous research and employment opportunities for motivated undergraduate students to both conduct independent projects and to assist in ongoing research conducted by members of our research group. Opportunities include assisting in field research and lab physiology, assembling and analyzing databases, and advancing models. Interested undergraduates should contact Lauren by email and include a brief summary of research interests and experience.
