## TrEnCh (Translating Environmental Change) Project
We build computational and visualization tools to translate environmental change into organismal responses. Details on the [TrEnCh project website](https://www.trenchproject.com/).

A key challenge in raising public awareness of climate change is conveying the ecological and human impacts of a given (e.g., 3°C) temperature increase. Biophysical models compute heat budgets for organisms and enable translating environmental conditions into potential body temperatures.  They can thus predict how warming alters thermal stress and performance.  They can be integrated with demographic models to scale up to the population, community, and ecosystem impacts of climate change.  Organisms interact with their environment at small spatial and short temporal scales, requiring downscaling of most available data describing current and projected future environments.  The high temporal and spatial resolution data will enable quantifying organismal responses to both environmental means and variability.  We are developing tools for visualizing the ecological impacts of climate change that will be disseminated through education and outreach programs.

## CORP (Colorado Resurvey of Pierids) Project
How do the morphological and physiological traits of organisms determine their responses to climate change? Which traits are more likely to evolve? To address these questions this project integrates lab and field experiments with mathematical models for two species of Colias butterflies in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. How temperature affects larval feeding, development, and heat tolerance will be measured and these results will be compared to historical lab data (30-50 years) to detect evolutionary changes. This project will also compare adult morphological traits and heat tolerance to historical data and museum specimens (>100 years). To examine how traits influence performance, reciprocal transplant of adults across sites at different elevations were conducted. These data were used to develop models that predict how traits determine survival and reproduction in changing climate conditions. To predict the impact of future environmental change on Colias model simulations with and without trait evolution will be applied.

## WARP (Washington Resurvey of Pierids) Project
Plants and animals have responded to recent climate change in a variety of different ways, highlighting the need to identify the biological mechanisms that can result in seemingly unpredictable responses. Incorporating the mechanisms into ecological and evolutionary forecasting models is essential to accurately project the biodiversity consequences of climate change. Dramatic insect declines, including of butterflies in the Western US, reinforce the need to improve forecasts for conservation planning related to biodiversity, agriculture, and the maintenance of ecosystem services such as pollination. Will insect populations move, go extinct, or be able to adapt to future climate change? Researchers will repeat historical lab and field experiments with Pierid butterflies to ask whether evolution and developmental plasticity of larval and adult traits relevant to thermal responses have kept pace with recent climate change. Modeling resources will be disseminated through the ‘TrEnCh’ project, which provides computational and visualization tools to Translate Environmental Change into organismal responses. Trainees will translate the research into TrEnCh-Ed inquiry-based modules with interactive data visualizations. Workshops will introduce these resources to high school and undergraduate teachers. The proposed research will partially be conducted via course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) at a community college with a diverse student body. The CUREs will introduce students to relevant concepts in plant and animal biology and to the research process. Some students will continue research and professional development training in the summer to facilitate their transition to a 4-year college and their retention in science.

The research will identify the biological mechanisms underlying evolutionary and plastic responses to climate change by quantifying how butterfly temperatures have shifted over several decades and developing a mechanistic model that links the temperature changes and traits to ecological and evolutionary responses. The following studies will test the mechanisms predicted to drive evolution and refine the model. Repeating field selection studies will investigate whether selection on Pieris rapae larval thermal performance curves (TPCs) and on Pontia occidentalis adult body size and wing traits has shifted over time. Studying selection on several wing traits across seasons will indicate relative selective responses to thermal means versus extremes and assay whether selection varies seasonally. The research will determine whether selection results in evolution of larval TPCs as well as adult traits and their plasticity. The project will test several hypotheses related to recent warming. Performance at high temperatures will be enhanced relative to the past. Wing coloration involved in heat-avoidance postures will be lighter. Wing coloration involved in basking may lighten in response to climate warming, but there may be selection for wing darkening to allow for performance in cool, early season conditions. These opposing selection pressures will lead to amplified seasonal variation in selection and selection for increased plasticity. The research will additionally assess whether genetic correlations and variation have constrained evolution and whether they have shifted over time. The research will further develop and test phenotype-based models to solve the problem of unpredictability in climate change biology.

## Gordon Alexander Resurvey Project
We collaborate on a grasshopper resurvey project founded by Cesar Nufio, HHMI, to examine shifts in traits, phenology, abundance, and performance of grasshoppers along a Rocky Mountain elevation gradient (since initial surveys and specimen collection from 1930-1960) in response to recent climate change. 

An NSF Rules of Life Project in collaboration with the groups of Sean Schoville at U Wisconsin and Caroline Williams at UC Berkeley aims to improve prediction techniques by investigating how animals respond to shifts in both average environmental conditions and short-term, extreme environmental conditions. Average environmental conditions over time determine rates of energy gain and subsequently reproductive rates, whereas survival can be strongly influenced by short-term, extreme environmental conditions. In many species, the relative importance of reproduction and survival in determining fitness change systematically along environmental gradients. Along a mountain slope, reproduction is constrained at high altitudes by a short, cool, growing season, while survival is challenged at low altitudes in summer due to hot temperature extremes. The project goal is to develop a general modeling approach that can bridge levels of biological organization, space and time to predict shifts in survival and reproduction constraints and thus improve our ability to forecast responses to environmental gradients and change. The project will greatly expand two education and outreach projects. The TrEnCh project (trenchproject.github.io) will develop and share additional computational and visualization tools to Translate Environmental Change into biological impacts. The Beetle Project, offering hands-on modules to study climate change responses, will focus on expanding educational access across levels of English literacy and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, the project will provide integrative training in evolutionary ecology, genomics, physiology, and quantitative skills to a diverse group of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students.

The project is leveraging survey and specimen data, from recent and historical periods, in an assemblage of grasshopper species found along a montane elevation gradient that vary in traits such as dispersal, phenology, morphology, and thermal specialization. Field reciprocal transplant experiments will quantify the integrated response to the environment, while assessing whether local adaptation and plasticity moderate reproduction and survival constraints along the environmental gradient. The transplants will use physiological and genomic biomarkers to test the hypothesis that survival constraints predominate at low elevations, while reproduction constraints predominate at high elevations. Lab common garden experiments manipulating environmental attributes that vary with elevation (temperature, temperature variability, photoperiod, radiation, hypoxia) will test physiological mechanisms that underlie fitness constraints. Model building will integrate these physiological mechanisms to predict responses to the elevation gradient. Then, historic survey and specimen data will be used to test whether these models successfully hindcast patterns of genetic, physiological, phenotypic, and demographic responses to 50 years of environmental change.
