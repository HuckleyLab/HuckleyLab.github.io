### Lauren Buckley, Professor
#### [CV](/assets/files/BuckleyCV_ext.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iik-8q8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Wiki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iik-8q8AAAAJ&hl=en)
Lauren joined the UW Biology Department in July 2013. She previously majored in Biology and Math as an undergrad at Williams College, conducted graduate research at Stanford, held postdoctoral fellowships at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the Santa Fe Institute, and was on the faculty at the University of North Carolina.  Some days it feels like we’re making progress in improving forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change; other days it feels like a foolhardy enterprise. Most days are fun. Lauren enjoys tromping around the mountains of Colorado chasing butterflies and grasshoppers during resurvey projects examining responses to recent climate change. Checking out the sites in winter on skis is her favorite. She is excited to be starting a local project where she can walk to a field site from her office.

### Monica Sheffer, Postdoc
Monica received her PhD from the University of Greifswald in Germany, as part of the “RESPONSE”graduate training group, which focuses on understanding how organisms respond to novel and changing environments. Monica employs interdisciplinary approaches to address this issue, and her work aims to integrate information from all levels of biological organization, from the molecular and physiological level, up to phenotypic outcomes for individuals, and how those outcomes shape population dynamics. At the University of Washington, Monica is studying how survival and fecundity constraints vary with elevation in a montane grasshopper system.

### Julia Smith, Graduate student
Julia is interested in integrating quantitative and empirical methods to understand the ecological impacts of climate change. In the Buckley lab, she studies grasshopper thermoregulatory behavior and energetics (see the field season picture on the left). She is modeling how climate change may have affected behavior, energetics, and ultimately fitness over the past 70 years. She is also passionate about education (especially teaching quantitative methods in biology) and hopes to get more involved in education research soon! In her free time, she plays guitar, hangs out with her ill-mannered cat, plays board games with friends, and makes elaborate color-coded weekly schedules in Excel that she will never actually follow.


<img style="float: left" height= "200px"  src="/assets/img/people/Taylor.png" alt="Taylor">
### Taylor Hatcher, Research Technician
Taylor comes from Wyoming, where she received her bachelor's in Biology at the University of Wyoming. While at the University of Wyoming, she conducted and participated in undergraduate and post-bachelor research on how extreme and varying temperatures impact various species of bumble bees. In the Buckley Lab, Taylor is a Research Technician on board to assist in the research associated with the WARP (Washington Resurvey of Pierids) Project. Taylor is broadly interested in thermal physiology and how climate change impacts pollinators' life history traits. Taylor is passionate about all things animal-related and loves having the opportunity to work with live animals in the lab and the field. When she's not in the lab, you'll find her indulging in her love for the outdoors, accompanied by her dog, usually hiking or mountain biking. 


<img align="left" height= "200px" src="/assets/img/people/Gwen.png" alt="Gwen">
### Gwen Shlichta, Affiliate / Collaborator
[Gwen](https://www.edmonds.edu/programs/stem/biology/contact/gwen-shlichta.html) is a faculty member at Edmonds College. She is collaborating with us to repeat butterfly research she conducted as a technician at UW.  She is involving Edmonds undergraduates via a Course Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) and also conducts education research.


# Former Members

## Graduate Students
### Anthony Cannistra, Ph.D. 2020
<img align="left" height="200px" src="/assets/img/people/Tony.png" alt="Tony">
Tony was co-trained in Computer Science and Biology at Tufts University. Before starting graduate school at UW, he was a naturalist at the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies in Aspen, Colorado. He’s interested in advancing the world by leading innovative computational approaches to hard problems.  He participated in the UW IGERT in Big Data and Data Science. Tony conducted research aimed at improving the ability of species’ traits to predict distributions and distribution shifts, leveraging novel sources of environmental data, and predicting the ecological impacts of marine heatwaves. Tony is currently a data scientist at Gaia GPS.

### Nassima Bouzid, Ph.D. 2019
<img align="left" height="200px" src="/assets/img/people/Sima.png" alt="Sima">
Sima received her PhD in June 2019 for her dissertation entitled “Diversification and Local Adaptation in Western Fence Lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis)”. She conducted undergraduate research at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley, where she was introduced to herpetology and trained in museum collection management. For her dissertation work, Sima integrated ecophysiology and genomics to study local adaptation of Sceloporus lizards along an elevation gradient in Yosemite National Park. The research aimed to provide insight into the evolutionary basis of climate change responses. She was co-advised by Adam Leaché. Sima is currently a data scientist at Invitae.

### Liang Ma, Visiting Ph.D. student 2015-2016
Liang visited our research group during his Ph.D. with Wei-guo Du at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Liang’s research focused on understanding the relationship between thermal variation over space and time and the physiology and life history of ectotherms. He parameterized mechanistic models with reaction norms derived from empirical studies to generate new insights about the process of thermal adaptation at both local and global scales. Liang is currently a postdoc at Princeton.

### Heidi MacLean, Ph.D. 2015
Heidi worked on thermal biology and examined how insects, butterflies in particular, are evolving and acclimating in response to climate change. Heidi was the lab’s first member at UNC and continues to be involved in the lab, but Joel Kingsolver at UNC served as her primary advisor once Lauren moved to UW. Heidi is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Bioscience at Aarhus University working with Johannes Overgaard, Jesper Sørensen, and Torsten Kristensen.

## Postdocs
### Chris Johnson, 2021-2022
<img align="left" height="200px" src="/assets/img/people/Chris.png" alt="Chris">
Chris received a PhD from UCLA working on how temperature and resources influence insect population dynamics in the Amarasekare Lab. He conducted further work combining theory with field and laboratory experiments to study how climate and species interactions affect ecological and evolutionary dynamics in the Bronstein lab at U Arizona and the Levine lab at ETH Zurich and Princeton. In our group, Chris returned to research exploring the evolution of insect thermal sensitivity. He's now working with [Sabine Rumpft](https://duw.unibas.ch/en/eco/) at the University of Basel.
